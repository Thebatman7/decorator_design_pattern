# Decorator Design Pattern
This repository contains code that implements the decorator design pattern. Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
Aggregation/composition is the key principle behind this design pattern.
