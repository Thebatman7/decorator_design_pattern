It is strange to think, I haven't seen you since a month. I have seen the new moon, 
but not you. I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but nothing of your beautiful face. 
The pieces of my broken heart are so small that they could be passed through the eye of a needle. 
I miss you like the sun misses the flower; like the sun misses the flower in the depths of winter. 
Instead of beauty to direct its light to, the heart hardens like the frozen world your absence has banished me to. 
I next compete in the city of Provo, I will find it empty and in the winter if you are not there. 
Hope guides me, that is what gets me through the day and especially the night. 
The hope that after you're gone from my sight, it will not be the last time that I look upon you.
